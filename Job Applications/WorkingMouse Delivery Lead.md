- A hybrid work setup gives you the flexibility to work from the comfort of your own home.
- When you need to come into the office, it is conveniently located in the centre of Milton, just 60m from the train station (the cafes and lunch options make the trip worthwhile!).
- Friday afternoon "Inspiration Jams" with beers and beats (on tap).
- Competitive salaries and employee benefits.
- A sustainable and fun workplace with environmental initiatives and active outings (such as our running or swimming clubs).
- Mentorship meetings with our founding partners to continue growing your tech career and expanding your knowledge.
