Dear Daniel,

As a certified Scrum Master with in excess of 5 years working with technology teams, Iâ€™m confident that I will be an excellent fit for the Scrum Master role at your client. I have experience working with small and large organisations using scrum and scaled agile frameworks. I also possess experience working as a software developer for more than 12 years and have a great understanding of the software development life cycle.

Currently as a consultant within Elabor8, I work with organisations to bring improvements to the agile way of working and delivery of products. Most recently with Michael Hill Jewellers I led software development teams within the eCommerce space through a transformation to an agile way of working. The following is a snapshot of my key strengths:

- Fostered an agile environment across multiple teams in a scaled agile environment
    
- Transformed software teams to an agile way of working through synchronisation of definitions of ready and definitions of done
    
- Worked in a scaled agile environment liaising with release train engineer and other scrum teams across 16 program increments (quarters)
    
- I also bring many years of experience working as a developer in multi disciplinary teams in Software, DevOps and Firmware spaces.
    

Thank you for considering me for this position. I look forward to speaking to you in person in an interview.

Sincerely,

Chamindra Rajakaruna
