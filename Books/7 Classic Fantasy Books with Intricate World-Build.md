The Fantasy Review’s list of 7 Classic Fantasy Books with Intricate World-Building.

The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1) by J.R.R. Tolkien
Classic Fantasy Books with Intricate World-Building
From the blurb:

One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.

In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, as told in The Hobbit…

Daughter of the Empire (The Empire Trilogy, #1) by Raymond E. Feist & Janny Wurts
Classic Fantasy Books with Intricate World-Building
From the blurb:

At age 17, Mara’s ceremonial pledge of servantship to the goddess Lashima is interrupted by the news that her father and brother have been killed in battle on Trigia, the world through the rift.

Now Ruling Lady of the Acoma, Mara finds that not only are her family’s ancient enemies, the Minwanabi, responsible for the deaths of her loved ones, but her military forces have been decimated by the betrayal and House Acoma is now vulnerable to complete destruction.

The Black Company (The Chronicles of the Black Company, #1) by Glen Cook
Classic Fantasy Books with Intricate World-Building
From the blurb:

Some feel the Lady, newly risen from centuries in thrall, stands between humankind and evil. Some feel she is evil itself. The hard-bitten men of the Black Company take their pay and do what they must, burying their doubts with their dead.

Until the prophesy: The White Rose has been reborn, somewhere, to embody good once more. There must be a way for the Black Company to find her…

The First Book of Swords (Books of Swords, #1) by Fred Saberhagen

From the blurb:

The gods decide to devise a Game of great fun: their colleague Vulcan forges 12 magic Swords, each with a different power, and scatters them across the world. Play begins in grand and gloriously violent fashion as Swords are gathered and used to control chance, enhance fortune, and change destiny…

Magic’s Pawn (The Last Herald-Mage, #1) by Mercedes Lackey

From the blurb:

Though Vanyel has been born with near-legendary abilities to work both Herald and Mage magic, he wanted no part in such things. Nor does he seek a warrior’s path, wishing instead to become a Bard. 

Yet such talent as his, if left untrained, may prove a menace not only to Vanyel but to others as well. So he is sent to be fostered with his aunt, Savil, one of the fame Herald-Mages of Valdemar.,,

Dragons of Autumn Twilight (Dragonlance: Chronicles, #1) by Margaret Weis

From the blurb:

Once merely creatures of legend, the dragons have returned to Krynn. But with their arrival comes the departure of the old gods—and all healing magic. As war threatens to engulf the land, lifelong friends reunite for an adventure that will change their lives and shape their world forever . . . 

Pawn of Prophecy (The Belgariad, #1) by David Eddings
Classic Fantasy Books with Intricate World-Building
From the blurb:

Long ago, so the Storyteller claimed, the evil God Torak sought dominion and drove men and Gods to war. But Belgarath the Sorcerer led men to reclaim the Orb that protected men of the West. So long as it lay at Riva, the prophecy went, men would be safe.

But that was only a story, and Garion did not believe in magic dooms, even though the dark man without a shadow had haunted him for years…
