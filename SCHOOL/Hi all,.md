Hi all,

I have updated our wiki to include links to

- Sprint boards
    
- DevOps dashboards
- Query locations
- Miro boards

for the Trade, ME and GO teams.
I think I have captured everything that I have created for sprint planning and sprint status monitoring. They are all linked below
[Migration and Enablement](https://dev.azure.com/michaelhill/IT%20Global/_wiki/wikis/IT%20Global.wiki/17932/Migration-and-Enablement)

[Growth and Optimisation](https://dev.azure.com/michaelhill/IT%20Global/_wiki/wikis/IT%20Global.wiki/17936/Growth-and-Optimisation-Team)

[Trade](https://dev.azure.com/michaelhill/IT%20Global/_wiki/wikis/IT%20Global.wiki/18023/eCommerce-Trade-Team)

Let me know if there's something I have missed and I can point Ricardo in the right direction.
