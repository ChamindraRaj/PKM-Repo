Thankyou for coming to help us. It's a surprisingly busy night for the helpers and you will most likely work up a bit of a sweat. It's great to see the event in action though as this really helps with the organising of it when you get to do this next year! We have had you guys in mind all year while prepping for this year's event and hopefully all the lists and notes on who is usually responsible for helping with which tasks help a lot. There is a new photographer this year, so potentially she and her helper may need a little help with getting sorted and a cool drink and knowing where the toilets are. Hopefully the rain stays away! Otherwise we'll inform you of rain plansðŸ«£.

Here's the run down:

ARRIVE 4.30-

Booked photos start from 4.30

FIRST HOUR â€“ music, drinks,mingling and snacks in the quadrangle. People taking selfies with friends in front of boards. Families and individuals having their booked photos from 4.30. Can orient people and tell them that they can mingle and have a softdrink each and one chacuterie per adult. Tell them about the photo displays in the hall and selfie opportunities. Locâ€™n of drinks and to go to tuckshop if special food reqâ€™ts.

FOOD:  
2xhelper putting out sushi and pizzas for the kids on the white tables in the quadrangle.

2x helpers handing out charcuterie cups to adults who would like them. There are 13 vegetarian ones.

2x helper on the donut board and lollies/popcorn. Weâ€™ll try and not give these out until the pizza is being served.

  

There will be the booked photo sessions happening in the end of the hall inside the gold curtain â€“ people might need help finding this!

DRINKS: One softdrink per person-2 helpers in the bar.

5.50- MOVE the large white numbers on to the stage. To the side that doesnâ€™t have the lecturn. Not too far off to the side though!

DURING THE CEREMONY:

Can keep extra pizzas warm in tuckshop oven/ pop sushi back in fridge and pop back out again after ceremony for guests to eat a bit more.

Put the graduation booklets out on the 2 white cloth tables in the centre of the annexe â€“ near the doorway out of the hall. Two classes per table â€“ they are in boxes in alphabetical order for the teachers to hand out.

Line up 3x white tablecloth tables for the pieces of cake to be laid out on.

Mr Walkerâ€™s class is the last class to walk across the stage â€“ REMOVE 2024 Numbers after this(coming through the stage door). Put the numbers back outside infront of the black champagne back drop.  
The kids then get up on the stage for their singing.  
After the kids exit the stage, take the cake in and put it on the black table on the stage with a knife (using the stage door).  
Mrs Hurdley then gives her speech and formalities and then cuts the cake.  
Once the cake has been cut on stage, bring it out through the stage door and cut it up into 120 pieces quickly. There will be spoons to hand out with the cake slices. (1 piece per child). There are special cupcakes- with names on for the children who have dietary requirements.

  

Check if Chappy can put the music outside on again after the event.

Kids are to leave with a graduation booklet, a piece of cake and their prep-year 6 photo card from the display.
