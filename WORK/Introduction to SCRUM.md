What is AGILE? What is SCRUM?

What are the roles in a scrum team

Product owner

Scrum master

(Development) Team members

Product owner - Owner of the product backlog determines the priority to maximise the value delivered by the team.

Scrum Master - Helps the scrum team understand and learn the agile processes. Facilitates discussions and sprint ceremonies.

Team members - Owners of the sprint backlog, focus on the delivery of the sprint goal as a whole team.

What about other roles - Business Analysts etc? SCRUM does not prescribe any other roles, but that does not mean a scrum team would not have people for these specific roles. 

What are the key events in Scrum

Sprint planning - The scrum team determines what stories need to be completed within the upcoming sprint in order to complete the sprint goal

Daily Scrum - Time boxed 15 minute meeting where the team members discuss how they are progressing in order to achieve the sprint goal. Any changes need and any blockers that would prevent them achieving the sprint goal.

 \- Only team members need attend

\- SM may attend in order to help keep the team focused on the 15minute time box limit.

Sprint Review

\- The scrum team and the stakeholders come together to talk through what was achieved in the last sprint.

\- Feedback from the stakeholders would be incorporated to the upcoming sprint in order to maximise the value being delivered. 

\- If the team needs to refocus their targets for the upcoming sprint this would happen here. 

Sprint retrospective

The whole scrum team comes together to discuss what went well, what could be better for the past sprint.
