# Notes for incoming scrum masters

## **Typical sprint processes**

- **Sprint planning**
    
    - Check everyone's leave for the sprint
        
    - What stories are being carried over? How much effort remains
        
    - Do the small change / discovery capacities need to be updated ?
        
    - What is our feature capacity?
        
    - Do we have any deadlines to hit in the upcoming sprints?
        
    - What are our priorities? High priority bugs, feature timelines etc.
        
    - Do we have any unexpected dependencies that we need to address?
        
    - Are there any action items we need to address out of retro?
        
    - Define the sprint goals
        
- **Stand up:** Table long discussions to the end of the stand up
    
    - Keep an eye on stories with large numbers of points, these can easily blow out further and affect the whole sprint. Make sure the right people are talking to each other when problems arise.
- **Backlog refinement / Sprint elaboration**
    
    - High priority bugs
        
    - Stories from next sprint
        
    - Refinement may also highlight when we need to talk to other teams / external teams for dependencies.
        
- **Sprint demo discussion**
    
    - How do we demo the work we have done to achieve our sprint goals. For those things that are more difficult to demo, it would be good to give the business a verbal update. Don't forget to talk about how the team is tracking to its PI plan and what important work might be coming up in the next sprint.
- **Sprint demo:** Talk about what the team progressed at a high level at the start of the demo. Direct to each person who has things to demo. Recap the PI progress status for the team.
    
- **Team page:** Keep the team page feature status up-to-date: This one needs to be kept up-to-date over the sprint for any changes. Anything high priority is reported to Ali and Sam post stand up (Sam is usually in standup). Ali would like scrum masters and the team to be aware of any feature timelines that need to be address during the PI, even if the SCs take outputs from the team we need to be aware of what is being done from their end.
    
- **Retrospective:** What things did we do well? What can we improve? What actions do we need to take in the next sprint? This is a sacred meeting for team members and team members only. It allows the team to openly and freely discuss any issues that may be affecting them individually or as a team. Listen actively.
    

## **Train level meetings**

- **Scrum of scrums** \- the sync up meeting between all scrum masters and the RTE. We talk through inter-team dependencies and how the teams are tracking for the sprint. Any issue (including support) that may affect the team's progress is also raised here. Be ready with detail for Ali about any upcoming deadlines for any features owned by your team.
    
- **Scrum master one-on-one with Ali**: Feature level progress update meeting. Ali will go through the features owned by each team with their scrum masters. It's important to make sure the feature status is up-to-date prior to these meetings.
    
- **Value stream sync ups:** Ali runs 3 meetings towards the end of week 1 of a two week sprint to talk through the status of features for Gas, Water and Electricity value streams. It's important to make sure that the team pages are up-to-date with feature status's and any risks that may be affecting the team and its feature deliverables. His report to the business will collate information from the team pages for each value stream. Make sure Ali is aware of any last minute high priority items.
    
- **Scrum master community of practice:** Where scrummy's get together to discuss things that may be affecting them? Run in the style of lean-coffee by Ali and the scrum masters.
    
- **Sprint awards decider:** When you get to talk up your team's work. Scrum masters and Ali get together to discuss highlights from the last sprint and which teams should be rewarded with Chips and bonusly at the Sprint awards ceremony.
