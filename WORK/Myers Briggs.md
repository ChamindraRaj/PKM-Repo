A little while ago I got the opportunity to take part in a workshop that allowed me to take the Myers Briggs Type Indicator assessment. It turns out that Juan also went through a similar process and suggested that we do a short presentation for Elabor8, so thank you to Juan and thank you to this group for providing me the opportunity.

The Myers Briggs Type Indicator talks about each of us having some innate preferences in how we interact with others, how we make decisions and come to conclusions and in general how we interact with the world around us.

So why I found this very useful as it gave me some insights into myself and the team i work with. I found that getting an understanding about the various personality preferences allowed me to improve my personal and work interactions. Often in my day to day i tend to deal lot with engineers who tend to have certain personality preferences. Knowing these has allowed me to cater my conversations to these individuals better.Â
