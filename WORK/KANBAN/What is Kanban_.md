### What Are the Kanban Practices?

For a successful Kanban implementation, the method relies on six essential practices:

1.  **Visualizing the workflow**: Creating a visual representation of the workflow helps to identify bottlenecks, visualize the flow of work, and make the work more transparent.
2.  **Limiting work in progress**: Limiting the amount of work in progress helps to prevent multitasking and improve focus on completing one task at a time, thereby improving efficiency and reducing lead time.
3.  **Managing flow**: Kanban aims to help in optimizing flow which can be achieved by monitoring flow metrics, identifying and addressing bottlenecks, and continuously improving the workflow.
4.  **Making process policies explicit**: Defining and communicating process policies clearly helps to ensure that everyone understands how work is supposed to be done, which reduces misunderstandings and promotes consistency.
5.  **Implementing feedback loops**: Kanban emphasizes the importance of getting feedback from customers, stakeholders, and team members as a way to identify areas for improvement.
6.  **Improving collaboratively**: Kanban is a continuous improvement process that encourages collaboration and experimentation to identify and solve problems, improve continuously, and evolve their processes to better meet the needs of their customers.
