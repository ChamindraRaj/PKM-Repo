Bumblebee program of work at UCQ

UCQ is transitioning to a new model of care delivery (Neighbourhood model) to allow more personalised care delivery to specific regions. This will allow UCQ customers to receive attention from care staff who service their regions. Along with this change UCQ is also moving from the existing staff management system Aurion and care management system Procura to Alayacare which will combine and streamline the management of staff and customers. The Bumblebee program consists of this technology change and is structured as follows

Capability

Epic

Story

Task

Squads are structured in focus areas -

Customer Experience

Integration

Care staff and Service Delivery

Data and Reporting

Billing and Claims

Customer and Care Data

Application and Technology

Squads were asked to identify epics in their areas and stories under each epic in a short space of time. This has resulted in epics being identified in isolation from other squads. There are stories that are dependant on other teams that have also been identified as work within EPICS for other squads. Individual team backlogs are not well managed as there is duplication of work and misaligned dependencies. The teams have not been given agile training and the agile way of working is occurring in name only.

It is important to note that the low agile maturity across the organisation most notably within the management structure is contributing to the programs shifting timelines - the bumblebee go live has been pushed out 3 times since its start in October. Conversations with other iteration managers within the organisation has highlighted the lack of buy in by the leadership group on the agile way of working with Rash Khan being mentioned as one of the few voices who see the value of a proper agile way of working. There appears to have been a call to structure the teams with a focus on end to end delivery at the start of the program but this call fell on deaf ears and has resulted in some of the problems being seen here. There is also a general sense of frustration among team members about the way the program is executed. It is the norm for teams to get theirs stories to a point of blockage or dependency and move on to new work.

As the bumblebee program is now reaching its SIT1 milestone, it would be a good opportunity to have a discussion on the problem faced through delivery thus far and use this information to refocus and restructure the teams post SIT and GOLive in October.

Problem areas

Teams work in Silos.

Requirements for EPICS are ill defined which results in scope creep as additional elements are uncovered

Program delivery timelines are unrealistic considering some of the problems around missing requirements and limited availability of individual SMEs and external teams such as AlayaCare.

While individual teams follow agile ceremonies, they show a low agile maturity and require training in order to gain a good understanding of agile way of working. - Agile in Name Only

Teams are not structured for delivery of “epics” end to end, leading to dependencies across multiple teams

The teams do not remain consistent with individuals often pulled into other teams for delivery purposes. This makes delivery within teams unpredictable.

Not all teams carry out story level estimation, epics are t-shirt sized. The lack of estimation with the team I am working with make it almost impossible to predict delivery timelines.
