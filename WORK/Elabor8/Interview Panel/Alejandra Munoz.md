Review notes

Good clear communicator

Knowledgable in her area of focus

Was able to build a good rapport with the interviewers

Asked insightful questions about Elabor8

We did not get to speak about her Agile experience, but I would say that she would be able to learn to work within Elabor8's agile environments and pick things up quickly. Alejandra would be a good fit within Elabor8 and would be great working with clients with the appropriate support network.
