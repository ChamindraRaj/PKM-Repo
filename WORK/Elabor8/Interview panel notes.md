Patterns and problems

- [x] Current work cannot be completed - burn up shows this
- [ ] Backlog in testing
- [x] Large tasks 20, 13, ?? blanks
- [x] Velocity vs number of planned points
- [ ] Story dependencies not vertical slices
- [x] Scope being added - 200 in backlog and 27 in progress after sprint 9
