**Company and culture**

***E8 Values***

I strive to aid others in Elabor8 and among clients in improving their understanding of agile processes. When working within Elabor8 and with Clients I look to model the human first value by promoting conversation and interaction between my team members. I also promote the use of actionable items and experiments to try to achieve the solution to problems encountered by teams I work with. Recently within the development team at my client Michael Hill I advocated and encouraged the use of pair programming and kick off sessions between senior and junior developers in order to promote knowledge share and build team cohesion. 

***Our beliefs, aims and expeditions, strategy and OKRs***

In my current and previous roles I promoted a culture of knowledge sharing through Development Communities of practice and Scrum master communities of practice. I regularly contributed to end of PI release train level retrospectives and advocated for team and train level discussions around problems and issues encountered by teams within EDMI. I developed and documented a process to introduce new hires to the teams as to the EDMI processes around SAFe. As part of my handover actions I developed a document for use by new scrum masters to EDMI (notes for new scrum masters) outlining the sprint and train level activities within EDMI teams. 

***Giving back to our community***

\- regularly attend virtual agile meetups and contribute to discussions on relevant topics. With further experience with clients i hope to present at these meetups in order to directly contribute and give back to the agile community.

***Learning culture and knowledge sharing***

Developed a series of dashboards for use within my client Micheal Hill Jewellers which has proven to be beneficial to client product owners and stakeholders. Presented the development of these dashboards to the QLD group in a knowledge share session. Also during my work within Michael Hill, I developed a series of templates for use in retrospectives allowing for re-use and saving on re-development time. Client teams have consistently found these retrospectives engaging and have resulted in great discussions and outcomes. As a scrum master at EDMI I was a regular contributor to the Scrum master community of practice and took the lead in discussions around system and process improvements within the agile release train.

**Personal Growth**

***Depth of skills***

In my previous role as a Scrum master at EDMI I worked with software, firmware and hardware teams as well as operational teams in order to achieve feature delivery through a program increment. I also have a background as a former Software Developer working in the .Net space. This experience gives me a breadth of knowledge when working with technical and non technical teams. In my current role at Michael Hill, I serve as a scrum master for two teams

***Consulting skills***

At my current client - Michael Hill Jewellers I worked with several scrum teams within the eCommerce and IT space in my capacity as a scrum master and team coach. I have promoted good agile practices such as having a way of working agreement, definition of ready / definition of done and ensured the teams follow a sustainable pace. I build strong relationships with teams i work with by using one-on-ones to build rapport and understanding. 

***Capability and professional development***

My experience as a developer as well as my role as an agile coach and consultant I am able to provide insight into both technical and non-technical audiences. With development teams at Micheal hill, I was able to help the development team come up with a system of managing the teams technical debt backlog. I was then able to liaise with the product management team to allow for the allocation of their sprint capacity.
As part of my professional development I am currently working towards a PSM1 certification having obtained the SAFe certified scrum master status earlier at EDMI
I have also attended the RAF course within Elabor8 as well as the Management 3.0 course. These courses and learnings have been useful in my interactions with client stakeholders and teams and allowed me to develop a good rapport with team members and stakeholders within the client.

**Client Delivery**

***Exceeding client expectations***

*Client feedback on the processes I have developed during my time has been positive. The product management team and key stakeholders have appreciated the insights achieve through the dashboards I have developed. Individual team members have provided positive feedback on my interactions with them through day to day activities and sprint ceremonies such as retrospectives*

***Stakeholder management***

As part of my engagement at Michael Hill, I developed strong relationships with team members as well as management. I achieved this through regular one-one-ones with individual team members and the development of a common understanding on ways of working. I also held regular sessions with key client stakeholders to demonstrate the current state of teams I work with.
In my previous role as a Scrum master I regularly liaised with Release train engineers and scrum masters and product owners from other teams in order to manage expectations and priorities. I regularly presented at key SAFe PI ceremonies such as PI planning and worked with Management stakeholders during PI planning and throughout a program increment to manage the delivery of key features from Software and Firmware teams.

***Leading outcomes / teams***

With the teams i work with at Micheal Hill, I have developed a system of introducing new team members to a team's way of working. I also ensure that teams re-sync on their way of working periodically in order to allow for changes in the teams working environment. 

Client coverage and support

**Business growth**

Supporting business development

\- working to build relationships with stakeholders outside the immediate eCommerce team within MichaelHill by hosting a scrum master guild.

Account strategy

Account growth

As part of my role within Michael hill I looked to expand Elabor8's presence into the wider IT group within the client. Though changes to client priorites prevented my continuation in this area those representatives were enthusiastic about my contribution to the project. I am currently working to build on those relationship as an avenue to promote good agile practice and potentially increase Elabor8's presence in the future.
