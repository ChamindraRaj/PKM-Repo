Hi!

As part of me being at my best in my role at Elabor8, I am requesting your feedback through our 360 Reflect. Along with other reviewers, I will be asking for your feedback on a few key questions. The questions are pretty open so that you can give me feedback on the things you feel will help most for my development and be most impactful to my performance. Personally, I've been focussing coaching and creating high performing teams, so focusing your feedback on these areas would be super helpful to me.

Thank you for your time and effort in providing me with feedback. It is a gift and I appreciate it immensely.

Kind regards,

Chamindra
