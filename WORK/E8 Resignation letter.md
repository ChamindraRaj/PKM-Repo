Dear Ryan,

As we discussed earlier today, I would like to let you know that I will be submitting resignation from the position of Consultant Scrum Master. My last day will be the 17th of October, which is 4 weeks from now.

This has not been an easy decision, I'm leaving to take on a role that will allow me to take my career to the next stage. I have really enjoyed my time with Elabor8, we have some great people here and I have learned lot that has allowed me to grow in the agile space. Thank you for your support and the opportunities you have given me over the last two years with Elabor8.

As I'm currently working with Uniting Care Queensland, will support the team in making the transition as smooth as possible for anyone taking over my role. I wish you and the team at Elabor8 continued success in the great work you do here.

Thanks for everything.

Chamindra Rajakaruna.

Hey Mark,

I wanted to let you know that I spoke to Ryan this morning and gave notice. I have taken on an iteration manager position with Hastings Deering. It wasn't an easy decision and I'm leaving to take on something in a senior role for the next phase of my career. It's been great working with you and thank you for guiding me through these last few months

Lets catch up sometime in the next few weeks when you are around town.

Thanks for everything

Chami
