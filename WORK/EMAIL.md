<span style="color: #000000;">Hi Team,</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">As we wind down for 2024, I wanted to say a big thank you to all of you for a great year. We've had ups and downs but it's important to acknowledge all the great work you all have done. We have achieved a lot in the last year and you should all be proud of the hard work you have put in.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">As we look forward to our break and starting fresh in the new year, I thought it would be a good time to reflect on the year that was and in the light of continuous improvement look at where we can do better. I wanted to sync with you all about all of our ceremonies and what is expected from each -

<span style="color: #000000;">**Sprint Planning**</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">This meeting is for us all to sync on where we going to deliver in the upcoming sprint. It's a chance to talk through any changes since we synced last that may impact any milestones that we need to complete by the end of the sprint. We will talk through -</span>

- How are we tracking against our milestones on the Increment plan.
    
- Look at available capacity vs planned work - Discuss the work planned for the sprint. Get a list of stories that we commit to delivering within the sprint.
    
- Create sprint goal(s) for team.
    

<span style="color: #000000;">*Preparation for this meeting is to make sure that we close our our last sprint of work and move any incomplete items to the upcoming sprint. We should also talk through any impacts to our timeline in this session. This is an important meeting, If you are not able to make this, please make sure that your capacity is allocated for the sprint beforehand OR speak with me in the next stand-up meeting. It's important to make sure we work at a sustainable pace and have conversations with our stakeholders as things progress through an increment.*</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">**Stand up**</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">This our chance to sync on how we are going with our delivery for the sprint. Raise any blockers we are running into and any changes that have come our way.</span>

- What did I do yesterday
    
- What I plan to do today
    
- Any blockers
    

<span style="color: #000000;">This is a pretty basic but easy way to talk through the work… I don’t see any issues with how we are doing things at the moment.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">This should be a quick meeting 15-20mins – I will look to keep us moving and any detailed discussion should be kept to the end of stand up for those interested.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">*If you are not able to make stand up please post your update in the chat for the meeting.*</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">**Backlog Refinement**</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">This is where we sync on how we are progressing against our milestones. Its chance to make sure the work planned in the next sprint is ready and understood. I think there's a few improvements we can look to make here. We have been talking about user story structures and acceptance criteria to ensure that we have a clear understanding of what the ask for each piece of work is. Let's look how we can leverage tools to make this process easier in the new year.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">*This is another important meeting, so if you are not able to make it sync with me and Ritesh after the next stand up. This way we can make sure that both Ritesh and I are aware of what work is coming for each of you and support as needed.*</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">**Team health survey**</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">The purpose of the team health survey is to get a temperature of how we are all feeling in our team. The value of this survey comes from making sure that each of you respond to this survey. In the past this has been sent out towards the end of a sprint.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">*I will make a small change here to make sure that the survey is sent out on a regular cadence. I propose the Wednesday before our retrospective. This should give you all sometime fill it out and a chance for us all to look at the results of the survey as part of our Retrospective on the Monday.*</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">**Retrospective**</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Our retros are the chance to reflect on how we are all doing and feeling. I'm glad to see that our retros generate some good discussions, and everyone feels comfortable to share and discuss the positives and the negatives. This is a sign of a healthy team so kudos to you all for fostering such an environment. I will continue to try and make our retros interesting and any thoughts and ideas from all of you to make it so is welcome.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">*One small change I will make is to make sure that we discuss our team health survey as part of our retro, so please make sure that you fill out the survey each sprint so that we have more accurate temperature for the team.*</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">**IM Sync (each Tuesday and Thursday @11am)**</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">You may also be aware that we have other meetings that I attend to talk about our progress through the increment. IM sync is the forum where all the iteration mangers and product owners talk about how the increment is progressing. It is also a chance to see how other teams are doing on the dependencies that we have raised. As we all know there are many curveballs that we have to deal with through the increment and this forum is talk about those changes and make the wider program aware. It is also chance to raise any blockers we are facing. A blocker is something that the team can't resolve without involvement from other teams. It may be something like "we can't deliver X in time because dependency Y will not be completed in time".</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">*Raising the blocker with the appropriate detail is important so that we can make the issue visible and get the relevant teams / individuals together to discuss how we might resolve or mitigate the issue. So, if you come across anything that may impact our timelines and feel like it needs to be discussed, let me know and I will facilitate this through this forum.* The blockers are posted on the R.O.A.M board where the blockers raised sit in the following categories -</span>

- Resolved
    
- Owned
    
- Accepted
    
- Mitigated
    

<span style="color: #000000;">Blockers often will sit in Owned until the problem is either Resolved, Accepted or Mitigated</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">**Chapter Sync (each Tuesday @1130am)**</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Chapter sync is the forum where the program comes together to talk through the blockers. Execs, Managers and Product owners talk through the existing blockers on the ROAM board. This is where the detail around new blockers and changes to existing blockers are discussed.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Once again team, thank you for all your hard work through the year. I hope you all have a wonderful break and spend time with the people important to you.  
<br/></span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Regards</span>
