Hi Jake
As  I get close to the end of my time at Michael Hill with this team, I wanted to reach out ask for your feedback. You and the team here have made the last year and a half wonderful and I'm going to miss the fun atmosphere created by being part of eComm. I'd love your feedback about how I did during my time here.
What are the things that I did well that i should continue to do? 
What is the one thing I could do more effectively?
Any other feedback?
I'd like to ask for your honest feedback and I promise not to take any critiques personally. I want to learn and grow and your insights will help me do just that.
Thanks for making my time here memorable. I'm going to miss our one on one chats. 
Warmly,
Chami
