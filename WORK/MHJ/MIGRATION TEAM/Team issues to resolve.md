Current DEV Velocity - 

What are the things that are causing stories to be delayed

Call outs from the developers

\- lack of knowledge and the requirement for input from Mudbath DEVs

\- Making sure there is more sync between DEV and UX on designs - what UX wants and what DEVs can deliver

\- The devs haven't been as vocal as they could be on when the original effort / estimation has proven to be too small to get the work done on the story. Actively calling on them to tease out this information will be needed. 

\- lack of expertise in Front end vs back end.
