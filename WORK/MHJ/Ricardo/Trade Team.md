**General notes on the team**
Ivy, Selen and Aaron play the role of product owner within this team. The team have autonomy to plan their work liaising with other teams such as Marketing and Merchandising as well as following the "Rythm of the business" this is the document that outlines the planned campaigns for the upcoming year at MHJ.
For stand up the team will go through the numbers from the eCommerce sales from the previous day for the 3 markets. This guides them on how they are tracking to their sales forecasts and budgets and may spawn conversations on how best to optimise individual markets based on how things are going.
The team will classify their stories into must\_have and nice\_to_have. The focus of the team will be on ensuring that must have stories for each iteration are completed and the nice to have stories will be handled as time permits.
This team is often interrupted by external teams who are not following the agile process. Marketing and Merchandising teams are often raised in retrospectives for last minute changes and other unplanned elements that affect this team. They are handling this by deferring these requests to Aaron.
