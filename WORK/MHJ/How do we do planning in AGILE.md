Planning the road map

Portfolio level

Program management level

 \- Roadmap -> 3 to 6 months What we deliver in this timeframe

 \- Road map for individual products - Product owners owning each backlog

 \- WSJF used to determine relative priority of Features

User story mapping for each features

WSJF - Weighted Shortest Job First

WSJF score  = Cost of Delay / Duration

Estimating cost of delay

User-Business Value -> What is the relative value to the customer or business? Do our users prefer this over that? What is the revenue impact on our business? Is there a potential penalty or other negative impacts if we delay

Time Criticality =  How does the business / user value decay over time? Is there a fixed deadline? Will they wait for us or move to another solution? Are there Milestones on the critical path impacted by this? What is the current effect on customer satisfaction?

Risk reductions-opportunity enablement value = What else does this do for our business? Does it reduce the risk of this or a future delivery? Is there value in the information we will receive? Will this feature enable new business opportunities?

Cost of Delay = User-Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk reduction-opportunity enablement
