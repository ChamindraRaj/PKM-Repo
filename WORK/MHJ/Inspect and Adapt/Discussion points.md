Discussion points

- Trade -> EComm story transition
    - working mostly well
    - we need to manage priorities and make sure the Dev's are aware of upcoming deadlines
- Tickets being pushed out without closing the loop with the PO
    - be more transparent and have more communication around tickets
        - understand the story workflow
        - build process
        - SM will re-iterate the importance of circling back with the PO when a story is ready for the next step.
- Design + Dev stories
    - Maria's view via Taylor - if the design work is substantial it will need to be scheduled in the sprint before
    - Design is part of definition of ready -???
    - We need to be deliver value
- Innovation? Tech debt delivery? how do we handle this?
    - Hack day? - John to speak to Keith
