What is SCRUM?

Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organisations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems

Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:Â 

1.  A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog
2.  The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an increment of value during a sprint
3.  The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next sprint
4.  Repeat

Why would we use SCRUM?
