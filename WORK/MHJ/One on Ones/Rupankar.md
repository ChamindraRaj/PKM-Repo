Going well with the development side.

Glad to have a variety of work

Adyen work is in hand

Communicated the focus on special orders for the upcoming sprints. - >

No problems raised as

======

PDP critical path issues - Mudbath sync needed, we are currently blocked on these Vue stories while we have the mudbath component incomplete. We can work around this but it will take longer and more changes than originally planned.

Adyen project is making progress.

Better than last week - Adyen

a lot of disconnect within Adyen - no one is fully aware of the work done before.

Daniel understands Adyen but does not understand salesforce - this resulted in time wasted - one month

Adyen testing scope has been discussed ... we need to sort out issues with the pipeline for them to test on DEV12

NOTE - we should account for some capacity from Rupankar for any issues that may come from testing.

Mudbath slack access is still a problem

Additional Adyen changes, needs IT team involvement... can this be fit in /??? not sure
