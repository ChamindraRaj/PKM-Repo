1.  Feeling the strain of the extra workload - 5 people's work across 2

No time for PDP

Aaron is not available when the team needs him - is more a stream of work than a manager

A lot of extra work coming into the team that is not visible on the board

Last minute campaigns are still happening and these are causing increased pressure and workload

Campaign launches are taking time out of homelife (late nights - 11pm)

This is not a sustainable pace

Actions for Chami

Make visible all the extra work coming into the team

Overtime and Interruptions - start to highlight the impact of these

========

Raise with AARON about sustainability

Overtime and Interruptions - start to highlight the impact of these

Run a way of workingÂ  - prep for this - speak to AARON -

Ivy has to manage the photography - organising ... this should be done between Damien and Merch

29/06/2022 13:25 - Wednesday in person

Raised that workload has not changed... as Georgie takes on more work in Marketplace, more trade work falls on Ivy.

Not all the planned work will get done - THIS IS OK... AARON UNDERSTANDS THAT THINGS WILL FALL THROUGH - PRIORITISE

Career conversations are happening, not having time to execute on actions is still a problem. Hoping that this will change with Emily starting

Merch is being very demanding about the Article styling

===== 24/08/2022 13:42 ===== in person in the new office

Feeling the pressure... more and more work is coming into the sprint

\- spoke to Ivy about reprioritising and pushing thing out to make room for the new things.

Issues with managing requests from Emily - she is not listening to advice and does not appear to be working off the same priority list as the rest of the team.

\- \[priority conversation with Aaron required\] push back on the requests.. .give information but don't get involved in completing work unless timer permits.
Product team and Trade team has been seconded to do engraving templates... this is very time consuming and will be time out of the sprint.

\- advised to add that as a work item in the sprint. Make work visible... and work to your priority list.

==== 07/09/2022 14:25 =====

Overwhelmed! Involved in too many things... no time to get work in the sprint done.

Emphasised priority - Drop all nice to have stories in the sprint for Ivy
