Hey Aaron, 

I wanted to reach out to you because I'm getting worried about the workload on Georgie and Ivy. Being one person down is, I fear starting to take a toll on the girls and I think we should try to address this sooner rather than later. 

The business has to realise that there has to be a cost to the the team's output when we loose 33% of the capacity. I'm going to enforce a hard 30 points per person next sprint to give the girls somewhat of a buffer through the week.
