# Notes for incoming scrum masters

## **Typical sprint processes**

- **Sprint planning**
    
    - Check everyone's leave for the sprint
        
    - What stories are being carried over? How much effort remains
        
    - Do the small change / discovery capacities need to be updated ?
        
    - What is our feature capacity?
        
    - Do we have any deadlines to hit in the upcoming sprints?
        
    - What are our priorities? High priority bugs, feature timelines etc.
        
    - Do we have any unexpected dependencies that we need to address?
        
    - Are there any action items we need to address out of retro?
        
    - Define the sprint goals
        
- **Stand up:** Table long discussions to the end of the stand up
    
    - Keep an eye on stories with large numbers of points, these can easily blow out further and affect the whole sprint. Make sure the right people are talking to each other when problems arise.
- **Backlog refinement / Sprint elaboration**
    
    - High priority bugs
        
    - Stories from next sprint
        
    - Refinement may also highlight when we need to talk to other teams / external teams for dependencies.
        
- **Sprint demo discussion - have this discussion two days before sprint demo after stand up.Â **
    
    - How do we demo the work we have done to achieve our sprint goals. For those things that are more difficult to demo, it would be good to give the business a verbal update. Don't forget to talk about how the team is tracking to its PI plan and what important work might be coming up in the next sprint.
- **Sprint demo:** Talk about what the team progressed at a high level at the start of the demo. Direct to each person who has things to demo. Recap the PI progress status for the team.
    
- **Retrospective:** What things did we do well? What can we improve? What actions do we need to take in the next sprint? This is a sacred meeting for team members and team members only. It allows the team to openly and freely discuss any issues that may be affecting them individually or as a team. Listen actively.
    

## **Tools / talks that I have found useful**

***RetroTool***\- https://retrotool.io/ \- Useful for running retrospectives. Its good to change things up every so often.. otherwise retro's can get stale.
