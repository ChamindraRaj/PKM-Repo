As I can see that you chose for a different seller mistakenly at the time of checkout, which made this price differ

However In this case

I do see that since this product is sold and fulfilled by a third party seller, our access to their inventory is nil. But do not worry, There’s nothing to worry as there definitely is a way out. Here’s what I’m going to do for you

I'll contact the seller on your behalf and would request for a cancellation and for the refund for this order.

Please allow me a moment to compose an email for the seller.

I have successfully contacted the seller on your behalf. I would request you to please give the seller 3 business days to respond back via email. If the seller does not respond to you within 3 business days we will file a claim against the seller.

Is there anything else I can help you with?

I don't understand how another seller was selected... the link i sent you is directly from the order i made...

I have also received a notification that the item has already shipped...

12:23

Ayish | Customer service

Then the offer must not be there when you placed the order

A

12:25

I disagree.. I placed the order due to the price i saw as the prime day deal...

12:25

Ayish | Customer service

However please know that we are unable to help any further cause it is an third party item, I have contacted the seller, please do not worry they will reply to you in the next 3 days

A

12:26

are you saying that Amazon is unable to help when a customer has been charged incorrectly during prime day?

it seems that the prime day prices was not correctly applied

12:27

Ayish | Customer service

No no not at all, I am saying that we are unauthorized to take any actions on such third party sellers, cause their inventories are accessible for the sellers only

So I am sorry to say but we do not have any other offers right now, however I understand your situation here

And I really do apologize for the inconvenience cause by this

Please accept a AU$ 5 promo as an apology token from our side

I've issued a \*AU$ 5.00\* promotional certificate to your Amazon.com.au account, which will automatically apply the next time you order an eligible item sold and shipped by Amazon. The promotional certificate doesn't apply to items offered by other sellers on the Amazon.com.au website and won't cover the purchase of gift wrap or additional shipping costs. A promo credit is an invisible credit present in your account and it will get applied automatically at the time of checkout only when you buy the items that are sold and shipped by amazon.au

Could you please confirm once you have read this?

A

12:30

I'm sorry, but a $5 promo is not sufficient.. I have been charged incorrectly by the amazon application. As a customer I expect Amazon to remedy this issue. Whether it is a third party or not I used the Amazon app which did not correctly apply the prime day deal... something set by Amazon.

12:31

Ayish | Customer service

Chamindra you will be refunded for the whole amount, So I just I request you to please give the seller, 3 days to process this up

And they will send you emails for further updates

A

12:32

Do you have a reference to this conversation that i can document

12:32

Ayish | Customer service

You use your order ID as your reference number, cause every chat is recorded on these numbers

:)

Is there anything else I can help you with?

A

12:35
