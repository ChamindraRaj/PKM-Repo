Workout Schedule: Perform this weight training program three times a week, with at least one rest day in between each session. On alternate days, incorporate cardiovascular exercises like jogging, cycling, or swimming for 30-45 minutes to enhance calorie burn and promote weight loss.

Warm-Up: Start each workout session with a 5-10 minute warm-up to increase blood flow and prepare your muscles for exercise. You can do light aerobic exercises like jogging in place, jumping jacks, or brisk walking.

3.  **Dumbbell Lunges** \- 3 sets of 10-12 reps (each leg) Hold a dumbbell in each hand, stand with your feet hip-width apart, and take a step forward with one leg, lowering your body until your front knee is at a 90-degree angle.

5.  **Dumbbell Chest Press** \- 3 sets of 10-12 reps Lie flat on a bench or mat, hold a dumbbell in each hand at chest level with your palms facing forward. Push the dumbbells upward until your arms are extended but not locked. Lower them back down to the starting position.

Cool-Down: Finish each workout session with a 5-10 minute cool-down to gradually bring your heart rate down. Stretch your major muscle groups, focusing on the areas you worked during the session.

Remember to start with weights that challenge you but allow you to maintain proper form. As you progress, gradually increase the weight to continue challenging your muscles. It's also important to prioritize proper nutrition, including a balanced diet and sufficient protein intake, to support muscle growth and weight loss.
