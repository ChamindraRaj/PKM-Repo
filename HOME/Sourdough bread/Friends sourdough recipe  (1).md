Mali's friends bread recipe:

Start in a big mixing bowl  
115g starter  
340g tap water  
Mix together  
Add  
580g flour  
15g salt (un-iodised if you have it)  
Mix together.  
i. It should be sticky without it coming apart. Add flour if the dough sticks to your fingers, a little water if it is not sticky to touch.

ii. If your starter is old and quite runny you will need a little more flour.

Cover with a tea towel for an hour  
Stretch and fold on itself for approx. 30 seconds to a minute.  
Cover and wait for it to double in size (slightly over proofing is better than under proofing).  
i. This can take from approx. 6-12 hours to a couple of days depending on how recent the starter has fed and how warm the weather is.

Shape dough into log for bread pan or ball for a dutch oven

Place into pan/dutch oven and let double again.  
i. This only takes an hour to a couple of hours dependent on weather

ii. I quite often chuck in the fridge so I can pull it out and perform this step at a more suitable time

If you feel fancy you can cut some lines into the top to make it look pretty.  
Stick into a cold oven and turn on. 220degrees C. approx. 45min for a bread pan, 45min lid on dutch oven followed by 15 minute lid off  
Remove from oven and from baking vessel and try to leave for an hour to let the structure set prior to cutting open.
