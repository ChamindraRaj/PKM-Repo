- ### Additional Activity Permission Form
    
- IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT CHILDREN SIGN INTO OUTSIDE SCHOOL HOURS CARE (OSHC) FIRST WHEN SCHOOL FINISHES BEFORE TRANSITIONING TO THE ACTIVITY SO THAT OSHC STAFF KNOW THEY ARE PRESENT AND ATTENDING. WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT THEY DO NOT GO STAIGHT FROM SCHOOL TO THE ACTIVITY FOR CHILD SAFETY REASONS.

- I will regularly remind my child that they are not to leave the Outside School Hours Care (OSHC) Service without an Educator. 
    
    I understand that the duty of care transfers to the external provider when my child is signed out of OSHC and no responsibility for my child will be taken by OSHC whilst my child is attending an activity or until my child is signed back into the OSHC Service.
    
    If the child is not returning to OSHC i.e. parent is collecting child directly from the activity, a School Plus Educator will sign the child out of OSHC completely when they are taken to the activity. 
    
    Parent/guardian can arrange for another adult (must be listed on the child’s enrolment form as having “permission to collect”) to sign the roll when collecting the child from OSHC to take them to the activity. If the child is to return, the adult is required to sign the roll again to show that the child has returned to OSHC.
