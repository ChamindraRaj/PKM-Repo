My journey at St George state high started with a move. A move from the big city to a country town from the hustle and bustle of Sydney to the tranquil mornings of St George, from a school of several hundreds to a close knit community. I had only been in Australia for two years when my family made the move from a city of millions to the small town of 2500 that was St George in 1997. I spent my final years of high school at St George from grade 10 to my graduation in 1999 and I still look back to those years fondly. The small town where everyone knew everyone else... where you got a good morning at the newsagent each Saturday. St George in the late 90s was a small place I graduated in the class of 1999 at the turn of the millennium among a class of thirtyish and headed to Brisbane to study at the University of Queensland studying Computer Systems Engineering.

UQ provided a window into the larger world and while it was fast paced and University life was a memorable time where I have met people that have become life long friends. After university I started my Career in Canberra working for the Department of Defense. Working in Canberra gave me an opportunity to see other parts of our country. After 5 years in the Capital I returned to Brisbane where I still reside today with my Wife and two boys. My career has spanned many roles from technical specialist to Software engineer / Developer to what I do today - An iteration manger / agile coach working with teams of developers. I have been fortunate to have the opportunities I have come way but i still look back fondly at the memories of St George and am thankful for the great teachers I have had during my time there.

\=======================================

My journey at St George State High School began with a big move—from the hustle and bustle of Sydney to the quiet charm of St George. In 1997, after just two years in Australia, my family relocated from a city of millions to a close-knit community of 2,500 people. It was a significant change, but one that shaped my life in many ways.

I spent my final years of high school at St George, from Year 10 to my graduation in 1999. I still look back fondly on those years—the small-town warmth where everyone knew each other, the friendly greetings at the newsagent every Saturday morning, and the strong sense of community that made St George special. I graduated as part of the Class of 1999, stepping into the new millennium with excitement as I moved to Brisbane to study Computer Systems Engineering at the University of Queensland.

University opened doors to a broader world, new experiences, and friendships that have lasted a lifetime. After graduating, I began my career in Canberra, working for the Department of Defense. Living in the capital gave me the chance to explore different parts of Australia, but after five years, I returned to Brisbane, where I now live with my wife and two boys.

Over the years, my career has evolved from being a technical specialist and software engineer to my current role as an Iteration Manager and Agile Coach, where I work closely with teams of developers. I have been fortunate to have incredible opportunities along the way, but I will always be grateful for my time at St George State High. The lessons I learned and the dedicated teachers who guided me played a big part in shaping the person I am today.

To the students of St George today—embrace the journey ahead of you. The foundations you build here will take you far!
