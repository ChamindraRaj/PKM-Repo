this keyboad sounds great and feels great. i have upgraded from the Techware Phantom 87 mechanical keyboard to a customised budget Tester 68.

XDA profile keycaps, Gateron milky yellowes, lubed stabilizers, case fitted with dampening foam, tape modded pcb

This things awesome and i have found my gateway drug to the custom mechanical keyboards.
