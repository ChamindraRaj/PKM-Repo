## <ins>*The Mystical Forest*</ins>

One day a little boy was moving houses towards the country. He was very excited until he found where his house was, on the edge of a forest! He thought it was a wonderful place in the morning. The butterflies hovering to the flowers.

But at night the wind wailed, the bats squawked and the forest was dark and gloomy. There was a thunderstorm too. One day he gathered up his courage to ask his grandpa is the forest enchanted? Grandpa was very old so he probably knew. Yes his old voice said.

So the next day he packed his belongings, told everyone he going to visit the other farms and set off into the forest.

When he entered he noticed it was full of beautiful toadstools, growing moss and logs. It felt magical! Suddenly, he noticed that the logs sort of looked like houses. Also there were tiny hanging houses. 

Just then a tiny winged human came to him. "Hello I am a fairy, you have entered the enchanted forest where gnomes, fairies and elves live in harmony" said the fairy. 

He was amazed and stayed for a few days, well what he thought were days you see, it was always morning with blue sky and a rainbow! One day he found an amulet the fairies told him it belonged to the fairy queen who went missing! They told him he could use it to track her back. A few volunteered to come with him. We headed to the dark forest . We jumped across mushrooms, trudged through forests, fought beasts and finally reached a temple. 

We entered and found statutes and paintings covering the walls. Then we entered a bright room, a crystal was there. When we touched the crystal, we fell into a trap. "Finally others" a voice said.

We saw the queen! "Wow" we chorused. We needed to escape. We noticed a wall of dirt so we dug our way out. Soon after we came face to face with a monster! We tried to fight it! But it was the fairies magic that defeated it! We came to fairyland and were awarded medals. Finally his quest was over. He went home and it had only been an hour!
