## <ins>My Camping Trip</ins>

My Camping trip was awesome it was with my brother, Mum and Dad and I. Dad said that we would be travelling in our caravan with the tent in the trailer, we were going to a clearing next to a creek. It was peaceful, but it wasn't in the morning. We woke up late and quickly had to do our preparations. My mum was cooking all the snacks and Dad was buying sausages and buns for the barbecue. Meanwhile, my brother and I were packing our bags.

The trip was long but fun. At the start of the drive we jumped in the caravan. A quarter of the way we stopped at 7-Eleven to fuel up. We were cruising on the sofa for the rest of the drive. Once we were half way we had brunch which were some sandwiches by mum.

Then we arrived! The creek was beautiful, water flowing calmly, on one side was the clearing where we were, The other side was a forest. Tall trees, bushes, everything was there. In the creek I saw lots of yabbies, tadpoles and fish.

Just then i heard my dad call me "Help us set the tent up" he said. The tent was big, it had two rooms! It took 35 minutes to set it up, the extra five minutes was because a squirrel stole the hammer.

Before dinner my brother and I went to the creek and caught a few yabbies. My mum cooked yabbie soup for dinner. We had dinner and excitedly went to bed (in the tent).

That night a storm brew and dad was worried the tent would collapse, so we went inside. We watched from the window worried stiff as the tent collapsed! Meanwhile I saw the squirrel that stole the hammer looking for a place to stay. I quickly put on my rain jacket and I brought him to our caravan. My mom and dad said I could keep him as a pet, it was awesome!

Finally it was morning. Charlie and I (the squirrel that I adopted) wen to catch yabbies. It looked like the storm never happened. After a few minutes it was time to leave. We headed back to our caravan. My brother greeted Charlie the squirrel and I as we entered the caravan then we left. I loved our camping trip it was memorable.
