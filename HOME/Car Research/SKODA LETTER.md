Dear Sir, Madam,

I am writing to you today with a request to please consider my case with care.

On the xx of December 2013 (just 9 years ago) my wife and I were looking for a new family car in time for our first born's arrival. And a mear 3 months away from his birth, we found our perfect car. A skoda superb xxxx. I had done a considerable amount of research and was certain that this car offered all we needed and more. At the time there were not many Skoda dealers in Brisbane, but we were set on getting a Skoda. We ended up finding dream our car from xxx dealership in Melbourne and shipped it to Brisbane where we lived. Details of the purchase below:

Odometer reading at the time of purchase:

We loved our new skoda superb and were quick to recommend it to anyone who enquired about the brand as it was not as widely used at the time.

We have always looked after it well. It had all it's servicing done on time and attended to by premium mechanic xxx.

On the xxx night I was travelling on the motorway for sometime and had just taken the exit when I realised that the gears were not working. I pulled up on the side of the road and had to get the car towed to my mechanic. This was not just a near miss and great inconvenience to my young family but also ended up costing us xxx for a new gear box. The xxx gearbox had xxxx.

This was very unexpected for a car that was not even 9 years from date of manufacture. We wrote to skoda requesting whether xxxx . But our request was xxx. Details of the repair summarized below:

Length of time without a car:

With a brand new gear box, we were happy and relieved to finally have our car back. But this did not last very long.

On sunday the xxxx, my whole family (puppy and all!) were travelling on the Gateway motorway 100km/hr speed around 9pm when our car started to vibrate heavily as if it was going to stop in the middle of the highway. My wife was almost in tears with concern for our safety. I only just managed to pull on the the next exit and organise for yet another tow truck. It was almost midnight by the time we were able to get back home all a little shaken with this unexpected ordeal.

We still don't have our car back. This time, the engine has burst. It is not only leaving us with no family car during the middle of xmas holiday period, it is also costing us more to fix it than the car is worth on the resale market. A summary of the repair required below:

Length of time without a car:

This car is less than 10 years old, and it has required a gear box replacement and now an engine replacement! It has so far costed us xxx in servicing and repairs.

Can you please consider our situation and offer us a solution?

We appreciate your careful consideration and timely response to us. Please respond to us within the next week if possible, prior to xmas shutdown.

Thank you
