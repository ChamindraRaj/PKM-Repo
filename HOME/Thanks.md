Brilliant work everyone! Dinushi you need to tell us your secret 14.5% loss!!?? .... Sas channeled all his anger into a 3kg weight loss this week to pip me at the   end... Congrats to you both taking out the wins. 

I want to say thanks to all of you... It's been a great challenge and the conversations here have kept me going and motivated.... Amazing to see how much we have all lost over the last 10 weeks! 

I discovered how much I enjoy running (never ever thought I'd say that!) nearly at 200km of runs for the year. I'm hoping that this has ingrained some new habits for me going forward. 

We should all get together sometime after Easter and celebrate! Have  a great Easter break everyone!
