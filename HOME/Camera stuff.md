To correctly set up your camera with the EF lens, follow these steps:  
Ensure the camera is on and the adapter is attached, Press and hold the 'c/p' button on the adapter. Keep that button on hold, and then attach your EF lens. Once the lens is secured, release the button.   
It took me awhile to figure this out. This resets when you unmount the lens and adapter.  
You can find these instructions in the product information guide as well (translated poorly). Hope this simplifies the process for you!
