Dear Appachchi,

I just wanted to put pen to paper to let you know some things I've been reflecting on. I'm not sure I have told you in my own words how much I appreciate everything you have done for us Appachchi. I look at my two boys and think back to what you had to deal with at my age. The massive step you and Ammi took to restart in Aus is the reason Malli and I are where we are today. I'm forever thankful that you took that massive step to start over in a brand new country.

I can't imagine having to do that at my age today with two little ones let alone two teenagers like you did back then. Thank you for perservering through the tough times to make sure that we could start our schooling and get used to all things in Aus. You have always made sure that we understood the importance of our education and I hope i can impart some of that to my boys through the years to come. I still remember how you sat with me during my assignments and exam studies and helped me understand what seemed to me like complicated mathematics and science. How you learned the QCS system in QLD to work out the best choice for me going into my senior years at high school. Thank you for always being there for us Appachchi, I know I can rely on you for advice and words of wisdom.

You have and always will be my role model Appachchi. You are the best father I could have and I am thankful for all that you have taught me. If I can be even half the father you were to me and malli, to my boys, I will have done my job.

Love

Chami
