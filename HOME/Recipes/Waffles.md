Preheat waffle iron.

In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. In another bowl, whisk together milk and egg, blending thoroughly, but do not overmix.

Pour milk and egg mixture over dry ingredients and mix with the whisk, stopping when ingredients are just combined. Stir in melted butter.

How to make frozen waffles taste better

If you don’t have time to follow a waffle recipe and make them from scratch, then there are plenty of ways you can dress up store-bought waffles instead. Tasty ideas include; fried, caramelised bananas with ice cream, waffles topped with mixed berries and honey, or you can even use waffles to make a toasted sandwich with your choice of fillings.

If you want to create something really impressive, why not try making our amazing Picnic waffle ice cream cake. 

Can waffles be frozen?

Waffles can be frozen, and reheated waffles taste just as good as when they’re made from scratch. To freeze waffles, and to avoid them losing their shape, don’t put them straight into freezer bags. First, cool them on wire racks as soon as they come off the griddle. Then, lay them on a tray that’s lined with baking paper, and place another layer of baking paper on top. Put them into freezer. Once frozen (it should take around 6 hours) carefully place them into freezer bags and straight back into the freezer. Frozen waffles last up to three months.
